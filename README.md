1. All aspects correctly implemented, I think. The table headers in the response don't quite fit the date but
that is cosmetic.
2. I had a short discussion with Foster Lockwood about the architecture of a web application.
3. Way too many hours, thinking there was not quite enough instruction. I spent a week trying to figure out what Node.js is and getting lost in way too many different languages and add-ons. For actual coding, I probably 
spent 30-40 hours.
